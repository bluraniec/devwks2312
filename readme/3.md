## Chapter 2 - Telemetry Application Stack 2/3: COLLECTOR

> :white_check_mark: We know already how to configure Telemetry on IOS-XR and Database in order to store that data.  
> :arrow_down: Now it's the time to setup the collection itself! :clap: <br>

Configure **Pipeline** data collector to gather streams with data from IOS-XR devices and push them to the InfluxDB database.  

**Pipeline** is already downloaded for you.  
For your own usage, you can download it from here - https://github.com/cisco/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline  

Continue with previously opened **Terminal**.

### 1st step - Pipeline.conf: INPUT
To consume data streams sent by the router on the collector side – respective configuration has to be provided in the *pipeline.conf* file. This configuration is always provided in this file **by default** so if you do not have to configure it in a different way – leave it as it is. **So, just review it.**

### 2nd step - Pipeline.conf: OUTPUT
In order to be able to send further collected data-streams to the database – enable InfluxDB by **adding** respective configuration under the *pipeline.conf* file.  
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# cd /root/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline/bin
```
Append to the *pipeline.conf* file configuration of the place where we want to send further coming streams using **vim** or **nano**. The configuration is presented below:  
```
[mymetrics]
stage = xport_output
type = metrics
file = /root/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline/metrics.json
output = influx
influx = http://198.18.134.28:8086
database = TELEMETRY_DATA
```

### 3rd step - Metrics.json
Go out from bin folder and edit *metrics.json* file in order to specify exact metrics that we are interested to push to the database (from the YANG Data Model):
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# cd /root/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline
```
Edit *metrics.json* file using **nano** or **vim** as following:
```json
[
  {
    "basepath" : "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-oper:bgp/instances/instance/instance-active/default-vrf/neighbors/neighbor",
    "spec" : {
      "fields" : [
         {"name" : "neighbor-address", "tag" : true},
         {"name" : "connection-state"}
      ]
    }
  }								
]
```  
Then example table entries in the database will look like:

### 4th step - Synchronization
Run script in order to make sure that Ubuntu VM with collector and database is synchronized with XR devices:
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# python /root/synchronize.py
```

### 5th step - Run Pipeline
Open Terminal and go to the bin folder of downloaded Pipeline collector:
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# cd /root/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline/bin
```
Run pipeline: 
```console
root@ubuntu:~/bigmuddy-network-telemetry-pipeline/bin# ./pipeline
```
Input InfluxDB credentials,   
**Username:** admin  
**Password:** admin  

Keep it opened, don't close it.
